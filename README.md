# Unity-Wwise-Game-Template-TowerDefense

Optimized for Unity Version: 
2019.3.9f1

Optimized for Wwise Version: 
2019.2.0.7216

PLEASE NOTE:
Mac OS Catalina has security settings which don't allow Unity to load Wwise soundbanks.
To bypass the security precautions that the Mac OS has put in place you need to type the 
following line into the Terminal 

sudo spctl --master-disable

Note that you'll need to enter your computer password afterwards to 
complete the command. This does leave your computer more open to hacker attacks, you've 
been warned, do it at your own risk. Then when finished working on the project, 
restore the settings by:

sudo spctl --master-enable 

Note that you'll need to enter your computer password after the command in order to
complete it.
